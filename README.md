# Recurrent Neural Networks for cognitive tasks
 This repository has distinct cognitive tasks, RNN models, and analysis scripts.
## Structure
- tasks.py: Each task is represented as a class. The tasks analyzed are:
  TICT - Temporal Interval Comparison Task
- helpers.py: Helper functions.
- models.py: Represented RNN models:
  Vanilla model.
  Alpha model.
  Low-rank model.
- model_parameters.py: dictionary with default model parameters.
- train.ipynb: Notebook used to perform the warm-up and the training of the models.
- analysis.ipynb: Notebook with the distinct analysis to the models
